Evaluate the task using the current screen and the previous transition. Do not assume earlier steps or outcomes that are not in this context. A selected action is not proof it worked. Evaluate success against what the task actually asks to verify. When it requires an element to be visible, confirm that element is in the current viewport; related text, off-screen hints, or accessibility-tree presence alone are insufficient. For other outcomes, use the relevant observed state or behavior. If the evidence is insufficient, continue inspecting rather than declare success. Missing visibility or hittability metadata means unknown, not visible or actionable. Use element types, bounds, and presentation hints to distinguish the requested element from related text or clipped content. Hidden-content hints are discovery information, not proof of visibility. If the goal is already satisfied, do not perform unnecessary actions unless the task explicitly requires replaying them. ' +
